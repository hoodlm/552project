552project
==========

This was a semester-long game design project for CSCE 552 at University of South Carolina by Logan Hood and Kevin Stahlberger, who are computer science undergraduates. It is not by any means a complete game - there are two short playable levels.

As of 8 Dec 2013, a compiled executable for Windows is available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/qddrpnib9utmsyq/based%20viking%20game.zip
